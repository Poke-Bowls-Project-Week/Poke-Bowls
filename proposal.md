# PokeBowls

Created by Ibrahim Hudson

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Poke Bowls is for people who like to cook. It allows users to find new recipes while catching their favorite pokemon.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Meal DB API (Primary) and the Pokemon API (Secondary). Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

  - API endpoint #1 : https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{ID}

    - Returns the data tied to a specific pokemon
    - [`name`, `id`, `sprites`, `types`]

- Link to API documentation #2: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

  - API endpoint #1 : https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i={ID}

    - Used to get the full data of a recipe
    - [`strMeal`, `strCategory`, `strArea`, `strArea`, `strInstructions`, `strMealThumb`, `strTags`,`strYoutube`, `ingredients`, `measurements`]

  - API endpoint #2 : https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

- Recipe & Pok√©mon Collection (Main Page): Users can save their favorite recipes while simultaneously collecting Pok√©mon as they cook various dishes. This feature encourages engagement by rewarding users for their culinary exploration.
- Unlocking Pok√©mon (Main Page): Each time a user prepares a meal, they have the opportunity to unlock and collect a new Pok√©mon, making cooking a more interactive and rewarding experience.
- Personalized Account Storage (Account Page): Collected Pok√©mon and saved recipes are securely stored in the user‚Äôs account, allowing them to track progress, revisit past recipes, and build a personalized collection over time.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

- Interactive Cooking Experience: The app provides an engaging cooking adventure, where users are motivated to try new dishes, earn rewards, and expand their Pok√©mon collection while improving their culinary skills.
- Shiny Pok√©mon Collection: Users have the chance to catch Shiny versions of Pok√©mon based on the difficulty of the recipe they complete. More complex recipes increase the likelihood of encountering a Shiny Pok√©mon, adding an extra layer of excitement and challenge.
- Recipe Difficulty & Regional Foods: Recipes will be categorized by difficulty levels and tied to specific Pok√©mon regions. For example, Kanto-inspired dishes may unlock Pok√©mon native to that region, while more advanced recipes could introduce legendary or rare Pok√©mon.
- Pok√©mon Capture Mechanic: After successfully completing a recipe, users will get an opportunity to capture a Pok√©mon. This gamified element adds engagement and encourages users to try new recipes to expand their Pok√©mon collection.
- Unlocking New Recipes: Defeating certain Pok√©mon in cooking challenges or achieving milestones could unlock new recipes, allowing users to progress and discover unique dishes as they continue their journey.
